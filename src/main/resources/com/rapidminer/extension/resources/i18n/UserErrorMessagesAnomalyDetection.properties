error.anomaly_detection.example_error.name  = max_features too big
error.anomaly_detection.example_error.short = You chose max_features as {0} but your table has only {1} regular attributes
error.anomaly_detection.example_error.long  = Please reduce the number of features selected

error.anomaly_detection.outlier_flag.cant_find_score.name  = Cannot find score attribute
error.anomaly_detection.outlier_flag.cant_find_score.short = This operator expects an a column of type confidence (score), which does not exist.
error.anomaly_detection.outlier_flag.cant_find_score.long  = Please check if it is present and has the proper type. You can also set the column manually.

error.anomaly_detection.outlier_flag.score_not_real.name  = Score not a real number
error.anomaly_detection.outlier_flag.score_not_real.short = Your score column {0} is not of type real but of type {1}
error.anomaly_detection.outlier_flag.score_not_real.long  = Please provide a numerical column. Maybe you want to use Parse Numbers to convert it?
