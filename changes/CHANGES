=== 3.0 ===
* Added new operator Detect Outliers (Clustering) which wraps the three outlier detection algorithms
* Detect Outliers (Clustering) provides a model to be applied on new data.
* Added a new operator Detect Outliers (rPCA), which also provides a model.

* Switched to an up-to date LibSVM version. Robust one-class is thus not available anymore. Results may differ slightly.
* Switched the lib for RNN operator, results may differ.

=== 3.0.2 ===
* Fixed an error which caused an NPE if the scored input set does not create cluster names like cluster_\d+
* Fixed an error caused by attribute names being not identified by name.

=== 3.1.0 ===
* Added a new operator Detect Outliers (Univariate), which was previously part of Operator Toolbox
* Added a new operator Detect Outliers (Time Series)

=== 3.2.0 ===
* Added a new operator Detect Outliers (Isolation Forest), which was previously part of Operator Toolbox
* Trees in isolation forests are now trained on a bootstrapped subset of the original data
* Trees in isolation forests can now define the number of features considered in every tree.

=== 3.3.0 ===
* Changed the role of outlier scores in all Detect Outlier operators. Its now a confidence (score).
* Changed the name of the generated score attribute in all Detect Outlier operators. It is now "score"
* Added a new operator "Generate Outlier Flag" which allows you to discretize the score attributes.

=== 3.3.1 ===
* Fixed a bug in Detect Outlier (TS), were z-scores wouldn't work with a reference set.
* Fixed a bug in Detect Outlier (TS), were algorithms won't work if the reference set is smaller than the test set

=== 4.0.0 ===
Please be aware that this release is not backwards compatible, since attributes got new names!
* Anomaly models are now serialized using JSON, not java serialization
* Normal Anomaly models are now IOTablePredictionModels, just like any other learner (except clustering)
* Since Anomaly models are now IOTablePredictionModels their response is prediction, not a score
* Univariate models are still Preprocessing models, but their main score is called prediction. all other scores are called prediction(attributeName)
* Univariate models are now stating the correct covered attributes in their description

=== 4.0.1 ===
* Fixed a bug where cluster models may create wrong results in applications, since they don't take the cluster sizes from training
