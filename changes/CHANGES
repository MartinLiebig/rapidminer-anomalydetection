=== 3.0 ===
* Added new operator Detect Outliers (Clustering) which wraps the three outlier detection algorithms
* Detect Outliers (Clustering) provides a model to be applied on new data.
* Added a new operator Detect Outliers (rPCA), which also provides a model.

* Switched to an up-to date LibSVM version. Robust one-class is thus not available anymore. Results may differ slightly.
* Switched the lib for RNN operator, results may differ.

=== 3.0.2 ===
* Fixed an error which caused an NPE if the scored input set does not create cluster names like cluster_\d+
* Fixed an error caused by attribute names being not identified by name.

=== 3.1.0 ===
* Added a new operator Detect Outliers (Univariate), which was previously part of Operator Toolbox
* Added a new operator Detect Outliers (Time Series)
