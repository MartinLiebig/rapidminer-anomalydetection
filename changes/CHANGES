=== 3.0 ===
* Added new operator Detect Outliers (Clustering) which wraps the three outlier detection algorithms
* Detect Outliers (Clustering) provides a model to be applied on new data.
* Added a new operator Detect Outliers (rPCA), which also provides a model.

* Switched to an up-to date LibSVM version. Robust one-class is thus not available anymore. Results may differ slightly.
* Switched the lib for RNN operator, results may differ.

=== 3.0.2 ===
* Fixed an error which caused an NPE if the scored input set does not create cluster names like cluster_\d+
* Fixed an error caused by attribute names being not identified by name.

=== 3.1.0 ===
* Added a new operator Detect Outliers (Univariate), which was previously part of Operator Toolbox
* Added a new operator Detect Outliers (Time Series)

=== 3.2.0 ===
* Added a new operator Detect Outliers (Isolation Forest), which was previously part of Operator Toolbox
* Trees in isolation forests are now trained on a bootstrapped subset of the original data
* Trees in isolation forests can now define the number of features considered in every tree.

=== 3.3.0 ===
* Changed the role of outlier scores of Detect Outlier (Clustering), Detect Outlier (Univariate) Detect Outlier (rPCA). Its now both a confidence (score).
* Changed the name of the generated score attribute in Detect Outlier (Univariate). It is now "score"
* Added a new operator "Generate Outlier Flag" which allows you to discretize the score attributes.
